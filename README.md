Check out more detailed smart contract Slither graphs with all the dependencies: [Yield Farming Slither Graphs](https://github.com/BarnBridge/sc-graphs/tree/main/BarnBridge-YieldFarming).

## Initial Setup
### Install NVM and the latest version of NodeJS 12.x
    curl -o- https://raw.githubusercontent.com/nvm-sh/nvm/v0.38.0/install.sh | bash 
    # Restart terminal and/or run commands given at the end of the installation script
    nvm install 12
    nvm use 12
### Use Git to pull down the BarnBridge-SmartYieldBonds repository from GitHub
    git clone https://github.com/BarnBridge/BarnBridge-YieldFarming.git
    cd BarnBridge-YieldFarming
### Create config.ts using the sample template config.sample.ts
    cp config.sample.ts config.ts

## Updating the config.ts file
### Create an API key with Infura to deploy to Ethereum Public Testnet. In this guide, we are using Kovan.

1. Navigate to [Infura.io](https://infura.io/) and create an account
2. Log in and select "Get started and create your first project to access the Ethereum network"
3. Create a project and name it appropriately
4. Then, switch the endpoint to Rinkeby, copy the https URL and paste it into the section named `rinkeby` 
5. Finally, insert the mnemonic phrase for your testing wallet. You can use a MetaMask instance, and switch the network to Rinkeby on the upper right. DO NOT USE YOUR PERSONAL METAMASK SEED PHRASE; USE A DIFFERENT BROWSER WITH AN INDEPENDENT METAMASK INSTALLATION
6. You'll need some Kovan-ETH (it is free) in order to pay the gas costs of deploying the contracts on the TestNet; you can use your GitHub account to authenticate to the [KovanFaucet](https://faucet.kovan.network/) and receive 2 Kovan-ETH for free every 24 hours

### Create an API key with Etherscan 
1. Navigate to [EtherScan](https://etherscan.io/) and create an account 
2. Log in and navigate to [MyAPIKey](https://etherscan.io/myapikey) 
3. Use the Add button to create an API key, and paste it into the indicated section towards the bottom of the `config.ts` file

### Verify contents of config.ts; it should look like this:

```js
	import { NetworksUserConfig } from "hardhat/types";
	import { EtherscanConfig } from "@nomiclabs/hardhat-etherscan/dist/src/types";

	export const networks: NetworksUserConfig = {
	    // Needed for `solidity-coverage`
	    coverage: {
		url: "http://localhost:8555"
	    },

	    // Kovan
	    kovan: {
		url: "https://kovan.infura.io/v3/INFURA-API-KEY",
		chainId: 42,
		accounts: {
		    mnemonic: "YourKovanTestWalletMnemonicPhrase",
		    path: "m/44'/60'/0'/0",
		    initialIndex: 0,
		    count: 10
		},
		gas: "auto",
		gasPrice: 1000000000, // 1 gwei
		gasMultiplier: 1.5
	    },

	    // Mainnet
	    mainnet: {
		url: "https://mainnet.infura.io/v3/YOUR-INFURA-KEY",
		chainId: 1,
		accounts: ["0xaaaa"],
		gas: "auto",
		gasPrice: 50000000000,
		gasMultiplier: 1.5
	    }
	};

	// Use to verify contracts on Etherscan
	// https://buidler.dev/plugins/nomiclabs-buidler-etherscan.html
	export const etherscan: EtherscanConfig = {
	    apiKey: "YourEtherscanAPIKey"
	};

```
## Installing

### Install NodeJS dependencies which include HardHat
    npm install
    
### Compile the contracts
    npm run compile
    
## Running Tests
    npm run test

## Running Code Coverage Tests
    npm run coverage

    
### Use the code in the scripts folder to deploy on Kovan

    npx hardhat run --network kovan scripts/deploy-kovan.js
    
### Update deploy-kovan-yfbond.js and execute
The output from the previous step gives four new contract addresses, two of which are "Staking" and "CommunityVault".
Insert these addresses into lines 6 and 7 respectively, of the deploy-kovan-yfbond.js file.
Execute deploy-kovan-yfbond.js. NOTE: The contract call will be reverted unless you have some Kovan-BOND for testing purposes in your wallet, but you can still get a feel for how the contracts work. If you would like some Kovan-BOND, please contact the Integrations team.

    npx hardhat run --network kovan scripts/deploy-kovan-yfbond.js
    
### Update kovan-manualEpochInit.js and execute to test Epochs
Update line 12 of the kovan-manualEpochInit.js file with the staking address given by your deploy-kovan.js execution, and run it

    npx hardhat run --network rinkeby scripts/kovan-manualEpochInit.js
